#  Rescuezilla v2.6.1 (unreleased)

* Fixed regression where swap partitions stayed unintendedly mounted causing restore and clone operations to destination disks containing Linux swap partitions to fail ([#515](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/515#issuecomment-2994462320))
    * Impacted Ubuntu 23.10 (Mantic) and newer variants of Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) and Ubuntu 24.10 (Oracular) so on the newer variants since Rescuezilla v2.5 (2024-05-12) 
        * Fixed related (very minor) issue where the operating system time on these specific variants were not being initialized as intended due to 'hwclock' not being installed
* Renabled Image Explorer (beta) after it was temporarily disabled in v2.6.0 ([#557](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/557))
    * Switched packaging the underlying "partclone-nbd" executable from the "checkinstall" wrapper to a more canonical packaging strategy using CMake's CPack (to avoid bug in 'checkinstall' script)
* Enabled Firefox on the Ubuntu 24.10 (Oracular) release after it was temporarily excluded in v2.6.0 ([#556](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/556))
    * Switched to installing Firefox deb package from "packages.mozilla.org" rather than the "mozillateam" Ubuntu Personal Packaging Archive [#506](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/506) (thanks engstk!)
    * The "mozillateam" Ubuntu Personal Packaging Archive now wraps snap-based packages like the official Ubuntu repositories, which remain incompatible with Rescuezilla's "chroot"-based build scripts ([#364](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/364))
* Added ability to specify NFS version: NFSv3, NFSv4 and the (existing default) of automatcally negotiating down [#408](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/408) (thanks OAM7575!)
* Improved touchpad support for tap-to-click and multifinger gestures using libinput driver [#506](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/506) (thanks engstk!)  
* Upgraded to latest partclone `0.3.37` (released June 2025) from partclone `0.3.33` (released December 2024)
* Fix minor issue with --compression-format=none to uncompressed in experimental CLI

#  Rescuezilla v2.6 (2025-03-23)

* Updated the UEFI Secure Boot shim package to v1.58 after a Windows 11 update revoked older shims by incrementing the minimum "SBAT generation"([#525](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/525))
    * This fixes any "SBAT self-check failed" errors to ensure Rescuezilla continues boot on UEFI Secure Boot enabled systems which require the latest "SBAT generation"
    * This also fixes the "revoked UEFI bootloader" message warning when creating a bootable USB stick using Rufus
* Replaced Ubuntu 23.10 (Mantic) and Ubuntu 22.10 (Lunar) builds with build based on Ubuntu 24.10 (Oracular) for best support of new hardware 
    * Temporarily does not include Mozilla Firefox on Oracular release until switched to new source ([#556](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/556))
    * Image Explorer (beta) temporarily out-of-service across variants ([#557](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/557))
* Fixed querying drives with the Bionic 32-bit version, which broke since Rescuezilla v2.5 due to using the --merge feature introduced in util-linux v2.34 ([#509](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/509), [#531](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/531))
* Skips GPG check on Bionic 32-bit release to fix build (temporarily) until better solution identified ([#538](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/538))
* Upgraded to latest partclone `v0.3.33` (released mid-July 2024) from partclone `v0.3.27` (released October 2023)
* Upgrades memtest86+ v5.31 to memtest86+ v7.00 ([#540](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/540))
* Updated the build environment OS to Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) from Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) ([#539](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/539)), which was needed for the UEFI Secure Boot "SBAT" fix above 
* Many new and significantly updated translations submitted using Weblate:
    * Persian/فارسی (fa-IR) (in-progress)
    * Finnish/Suomi (fi-FI)
    * Romanian/Rolână (ro-RO) (in-progress)
    * Tamil/தமிழ் (ta-IN)
    * Norwegian Bokmål/Norsk Bokmål (nb-NO) (significantly updated)
    * Japanese/日本語 (ja-JP) (significantly updated)

# Rescuezilla v2.5.1 (2024-09-08)

* Stops running the `ntfsfix --clear-dirty` on NTFS filesystems on the SOURCE DISK during backup and clone operations ([#466](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/466))
  * Running this command (the only command in Rescuezilla that modifies the source disk) appears to be the root cause of a critical severity error that impacted a small number of (hibernated) Windows disks since the command was added in Rescuezilla v2.3 (2021-12-24) where creating a backup image or clone appears to cause some kind of corruption that can break the Windows boot with a Blue Screen of Death, possibly due to corruption in the Windows BCD (Boot Configuration Data)
  * However, I still have not been able to reproduce the error in despite many hours of testing
  * Removing this command will likely mean more 'hibernated NTFS disk' errors on backup or clone of Windows disks if not booting into Rescuezilla with the 'Restart' Start Menu command -- but removing the apparently dangerous command is obviously worthwhile
* Fixed 'stuck at 0%' bug for backup and cloning when only one partition is selected, bug introduced in v2.5.0 ([#482](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/482))
* Fixed several user-interface disconnects where upon an error the user-interface correctly jumped to the Summary page but the backup, clone or restore operation mistakenly continues in background, causing a disconnect in what the user-interface shows compared to the operation that's occurring. The cases identified were:
  * On backup/clone if an NTFS filesystem fails to unmount after being checked for Windows Boot Reserved partition information ([#501](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/501))
  * On backup/clone/restore if a Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is fails to be shutdown ([#501](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/501))
  * If partition fails to unmount when when a backup or clone operation ([#501](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/501))
* Upgraded to latest partclone `v0.3.32` (released mid-July 2024) from partclone `v0.3.27` (released October 2023)
  * Examining the partclone projects commit log indicates key changes are:
    * Several partclone errors cases now no longer return success upon failure
    * Upgraded BTRFS support to BTRFS v6.8.1 from BTRFS v6.3.3

 # Rescuezilla v2.5 (2024-05-12)

* Adds release based on Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble), Ubuntu 23.10 (Mantic) and Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar) for best support of new hardware
* Upgrades to latest partclone release `v0.3.27` (released October 2023) from `v0.3.20` (which was released in April 2022)
  * This should improve issues with BTRFS filesystems, as it supports BTRFS v6.3.3, rather than v5.11 ([#393](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/393#issuecomment-1718658170))
* Added experimental command-line interface (CLI) ([#258](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/258))
  * CLI should be considered EXPERIMENTAL and UNSTABLE, and behavior may change between versions without notice
  * CLI only supports images created by Clonezilla and Rescuezilla (the other supported formats coming in future)
  * CLI only supports backup, verify, restore and clone operations (mount and unmount operations coming in future)
* Integrated Rescuezilla into the automated integration test suite scripts, to hopefully enable faster project iteration
* Continue image scan after an error, so permission denied on irrelevant folders no longer block populating the image list
* Fixed issue causing backup of Linux md RAID devices containing MBR partition tables to fail ([#448](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/448))
* Installs 'hashdeep' package as stop-gap command-line workaround for a specific user niche until Rescuezilla's UI handles it ([#441](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/441))
* Fixed failing restore and clone operations when Rescuezilla v2.4.2 booted into Portuguese language, due to a minor typo ([#438](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/438))
* Prevent laptops from sleeping when is lid closed ([#427](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/427))

# Rescuezilla v2.4.2 (2023-03-05)

* Removes the Intel screen tearing fix introduced for v2.3 (2021-12-24), which should fix black screens on Intel graphics ([#281](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/281#issuecomment-1345457445))
* Introduces Ubuntu 22.10 (Kinetic) for best support of recent hardware, but leaves default build as Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy)
* Reintroduces a 32-bit (Intel i386) build, currently based on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) (#232) after it was temporarily dropped in Rescuezilla v2.0 (2020-10-14) 
    * Note: Partclone backwards compatibility is imperfect and 32-bit release uses old Ubuntu repository partclone version, not latest compiled version
* Fixes Backup mode's broken SSH port field introduced in v2.4 ([#385](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/385))
* Installs lxappearance ([#274](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/274)), hexdump (bsdmainutils) ([#382](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/382)), flashrom ([#388](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/388))
* Installed packages which improve ability to mount encrypted drives with pcmanfm file manager ([#379](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/379))
* Replaces out-of-service Travis-CI build bot integration with GitHub Actions, for improved quality-control, and to assist Rescuezilla contributors
* Many existing translations updated, but also added:
  * Albanian/Shqip (sq-AL) (Translation in-progress)
  * Lithuanian/Lietuvių (lt-LT)
  * Dutch/Nederlands (nl-NL)

# Rescuezilla v2.4.1 (2022-09-05)

* Fixed broken wifi after v2.4 broke it (due to a change in Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy [leading to a key package not being installed (#366)](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/366#issuecomment-1214413260)
* Reintroduced ISO variant based on Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal), to assist users with AMD/Intel graphics
    * AMD/Intel graphics still expected to be broken on "Jammy" variant except when using Graphical Fallback Mode ([#351](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/351))
* Fixed image verification for German language [(broken for all images in v2.4 German language mode, due to a typo in a translation string) (#352)]((https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/352))
    * Fixed similar fatal user-facing error messages caused by translation typos in the French, Danish and Catalan translations
* Add the font to fix display of the cross mark character "❌" in the image verification summary
* Fixed "stuck at 0%" progress bar when the destination is read-only ([#363](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/363))
    * Added protection to prevent other unexpected situations from leading to the same behavior
* Many existing translations updated, but also added:
  * Thai/ภาษาไทย (th-TH)

# Rescuezilla v2.4 (2022-08-07)

* Replaces Ubuntu 21.10 (Impish) build with build based on Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) for best support of new hardware 
* Builds latest version of partclone from source code `v0.3.20`, instead of OS package ([#168](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/168), [#309](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/309), [#335](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/335))
    * This fixes "unsupported feature" error for users of compressed BTRFS filesystems (such as Fedora Workstation 33 and newer)
* Removed old partclone v0.2.43 used to _maximize_ legacy Redo Backup compatibility (modern partclone still provides good backwards compatibility)
* Fixed execution of Clonezilla EFI NVRAM script to better correctly handle reboot on EFI systems (#348)
* Switched Firefox to using the Mozilla Team PPA repository, because new "snap" packaging is incompatible with Rescuezilla's build scripts ([#364](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/364))
* Added ability to compress images using bzip2 algorithm ([#290](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/290))
* Moved post-completion action to in-progress page ([#316](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/316))

**KNOWN BUG: When cloning, user reported the auto-restart/auto-shutdown drop-down breaks the clone ([#337](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/337))**. I tried in the "restore" mode on my environment with several images and it worked fine. This report is still being further investigated for the "clone" mode, but I didn't want it to block release of the Jammy upgrade.

  * Chinese (Simplified)/中文(简体) (zh-CN) ([#191](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/191))
  * Chinese (Traditional)/中文(繁體) (zh-Hant)
  * Norwegian Bokmål/Norsk Bokmål (nb-NO)
  * Russian/Русский (ru-RU) \[[translation in-progress](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/270#issuecomment-939196164)\]

* [**RESCUEZILLA IS OPEN FOR TRANSLATIONS!**](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/wiki/Translations-HOWTO)

# Rescuezilla v2.1 (2020-12-12) 

* Added ‘Image Explorer’ (beta) to easily mount partclone images and extract files ([#20](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/20))
  * Currently based on `partclone-nbd`
  * Rescuezilla intends on switching to using the more popular `partclone-utils` project (which can also mount `ntfsclone` images)
  * Accessing files from **uncompressed** images (created by Clonezilla's Expert Mode) is _extremely_ fast even for very large images
  * Both Clonezilla and Rescuezilla currently default to gzip compression, which requires decompressing a lot of data and makes mounting and exploring images over 50GB too slow.
  * A future release of Rescuezilla will change the default compression format so mounting large images is always fast and efficient
* Switched primary release to new build based on Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy) for improved NVidia graphics card support ([#115](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/115))
* Fixed slow backup speed after mistakenly switching away from pigz multithreaded compression ([#125](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/125))
* Fixed scan issue on some Redo Backup v0.9.8-v1.0.4, Rescuezilla v1.0.5-v1.0.6.1 images ([#127](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/127))
* Added ability to cancel the image scan by closing the progress bar popup ([#126](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/126))
* Displayed more progress details during drive query and image scan ([#126](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/126))

* Switched ISOLINUX bootloader to GRUB affecting all boot approaches: BIOS, EFI and CD-ROM
* Upgraded OS base to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal) from 18.04 LTS (Bionic) [64-bit only] ([#51](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/51))
* Ubuntu 20.04 has dropped 32-bit, so Rescuezilla 32-bit remains based on Ubuntu 18.04
* Fixed issue preventing backup/restore of hard drives smaller than typically ~40 megabytes ([#55](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/55))
* Fixed broken GRUB backup affecting _some_ 1MiB-aligned filesystems on MBR-formatted disks, by copying all of “post-MBR gap” between MBR and first partition, not just typical 32KiB. ([#50](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/50))

* Installs Rescuezilla frontend as a deb package, which increases flexibility of installation ([#13](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/13))
* Moved scripts from tertiary File Hierarchy Standard (eg, /usr/local/sbin/rescuezilla) to secondary FHS (eg, /usr/sbin/rescuezilla) as the rationale that scripts were “developed by the system administrator of the system it is deployed on” is no longer valid when installing as a deb package
* Minimized divergence of Rescuezilla 32-bit and 64-bit package environment: (see below)
* Replaced Chromium Web Browser with Firefox to avoid Ubuntu 20.04 snap-based packaging as [snaps cannot yet](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/issues/63) be installed in chroot-based environments (which the Rescuezilla build uses)
